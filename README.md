This is a monitor screen that doctor can check the ECG data for the patient.
Doctor can choose any patient and get the summary from the csv file.

## Start the app

To start the server run `npm start` to start the angular app run `npm run dev`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/.
You will get noticed when there is new data arrive.

Happy exploring!

## How to add new data:

data can be passed by a post requeset from any system.
Here to play it on your own with postman:

## Tech

Project implemented with Angular17 nestjs10, node version : 18.18.2

## Architecture

In the backend we have 3 endpoint

- a post method: which accept the csv file and patient name also the start time
- a websocket: so that the client can get notified when new data arrived
- a get method: which will return the holter record summary according to the user and time slot.

csv file structure:
type | waveOn | waveEnd | tags

Time format:
Since in ECG data millesecond is wild used to measure the wave. So in our system, we save data as millesecond number.
It can be easily filter in database or calculate during the runing time. And also the ECG data normally should be based on the current time which means time greater than 1970. So with millesecond data it is enough for us in current situation.

On the client side.

## what's next:

- Provide a ui on client side to easily upload the csv file.
- Implement time slot component on client side so that we can check data with time range.
- Implement sql database to save data to simply the data management process on backend
- UI fine tuning
